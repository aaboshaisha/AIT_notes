    "Another way: we try to find the minimal set of instructions `p` that can be decoded into `s`. These instructions will have to depend on the machine that executes them. Think for example of writing some program in LISP or Python. Each will have a different syntax / instruction set to achieve the same goal. You will write each description (program) in a different way based on the interpreter (machine: LISP interpreter vs Python interpreter). In the formula above, that is equivalent to changing machine `U` to `V` (so we get $C_V {s}$ and $V(p)$). Does that mean complexity is machine dependent and thus subjective? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans is NO (alomst). Even if U and V contain different instrction stes, programs on V can't be much longer than programs on U. Since both U, V are turing machines, one can simulate the other.
